## Next Steps
* 16.02. request Twitter API access
* 23.02. Twitter datasets: One tweet id per line, txt file; 5 new datasets
* 02.03. Twitter datasets: twarc gets tweet texts via API; convert to csv file; 5 new datasets
* 09.03. 5 new datasets
* 16.03. merge class labels or split; combine multiple datasets; 5 new datasets
* postponed: generate dataset statistics


### Implementation
* ~~logging https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html~~
* ~~progress bar, tqdm https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm~~
* ~~let's add a requirements.txt so that users can simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt`~~

### Store per csv file: 
* name of the file, e.g., authorYEARlang (schmidt2021de)
* hash (to check whether any changes have been made to the dataset)
* language (en, de)
* source platform (Twitter, ...)

### Store per row in each csv file:
* id (str)
* text (str)
* label1 (str), 
* label2 (str)
This list can be extended later (timestamp, response text, ...)
Let's not use booleans or integers as values in the label column but more explicit strings, such as "offensive"

### More datasets we should also include:
